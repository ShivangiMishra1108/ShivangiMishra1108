# 🎤 Hey there!  

When I’m not belting out my favorite tunes, you’ll find me coding up a storm!  
I’m a **Computer Science student** with a passion for all things **MERN stack** — think **MongoDB**, **Express.js**, **React**, and **Node.js** (plus a dash of good old **C++** and **DSA** for extra flavor).  

🌐 I’ve been leveling up my skills through **open source contributions**, collaborating with awesome developers, and making a real impact in the tech community. _(Ask me about my latest project — I love to geek out over it!)_  

## 💻 My Toolbox
- **HTML, CSS & JavaScript** (the classic trio)  
- **React** (for those slick UIs)  
- **MongoDB** (because data deserves a cool home)  
- **C++ & DSA** (I like my algorithms efficient and my logic sharp!)

## 🎶 A Bit About Me
Whether I’m **singing**, **coding**, or **solving problems**, I love to learn new things and connect with like-minded people.  
Let’s build something amazing together — or just share some playlists!
